<h1>Project 4: The Unix Shell</h1>

<!--
<b>Under construction.  Will be released officially on May 14th</b>
-->
</center> 


<!-- =========================================================== -->
<!-- =========================================================== -->
<!-- =========================================================== -->
<h1>Objectives</h1> 

<p>There are four objectives to this assignment:</p> 

<ul>
<li><b>To write a complete program from scratch.</b>  
We only provide a small code skeleton.  

<li><b>To learn about shell functionalities.</b>  You will
familiarize yourself with the Linux programming environment
and gain exposure to the necessary functionality in shells.</li> 

<li><b>To learn about process interaction</b>. You will learn about
how a process is started, how a parent process waits for the child
to terminate, how processes communicate via pipes, and so on.

<li><b>To learn about defensive programming.</b>
In real life, users input invalid values.  Your program
should perform "sanity checks."


</ul> 


<!-- =========================================================== -->
<!-- =========================================================== -->
<!-- =========================================================== -->
<h1>Overview</h1> 

<p>In this assignment, you will implement a <b>command line
interpreter</b> or <b>shell.</b> The shell should operate in this basic
way: when you type in a command (in response to its prompt), the shell
creates a child process that executes the command you entered and then
prompts for more user input when it has finished.</p> 

<p>The shell you implement will be similar to, but much simpler than,
the one you run every day in Unix. You can find out which shell you
are running by typing <code>"echo $SHELL"</code> at a prompt. You may then
wish to look at the man pages for 'sh' or the shell you are running
(more likely tcsh or bash) to learn more about all of the
functionality that a shell can support. For this project, you do not need
to implement much functionality.</p> 



<!-- =========================================================== -->
<!-- =========================================================== -->
<!-- =========================================================== -->
<h1>Program Specifications</h1> 


<!-- ------------------------------- spec -->
<h3>Basic Shell</h3> 

<p>Your basic shell is basically an interactive loop: it repeatedly prints
a prompt <code>"myshell> "</code>, parses the input, executes the command
specified on that line of input, and waits for the command to
finish. 


<blockquote><pre>
linux3% ./myshell
myshell>
</pre> </blockquote> 


This is repeated until the user types "exit".  (Please note that there is a
space after <code>myshell></code> sign in the prompt).  The name of your final
executable should be
<b>myshell</b>.

<p>You should structure your shell such that it creates a new process for each
new command.  The only exception is that if the command is a built-in command
(see below) you should not call <code>fork</code>.



<!-- ------------------------------- spec -->
<h3>Parsing a Command Line</h3>


<p>Your basic shell should be able to parse a command, and run the
program corresponding to the command. For example, if the user types
<code>"ls -la /tmp"</code> , your shell should run the <code>ls</code>
program with all the given arguments and print the output on the
screen.</p>

<p>
The maximum length of a command line your shell can take is 512 bytes
(excluding the newline).</p> 



<!-- ------------------------------- spec -->
<h3>Multiple Commands</h3> 

<p>After you get your basic shell running, your shell is not too fun
if you cannot run multiple jobs on a single command line. To do that,
we use the <code>";"</code> character to separate multiple jobs on a
single command line.</p> 

<p>For example, if the user types <code>"ls; ps; who"</code> , the jobs
should be run one at a time, in left-to-right order. Hence, in our previous
example ( <code>"ls; ps; who"</code> ), first <code>ls</code> should run to
completion, then <code>ps</code> , then <code>who</code> . The prompt
should not be shown again until all jobs are complete.</p>


<!-- ------------------------------- spec -->
<h3>Built-in Commands</h3> 

<p>
Whenever your shell accepts a command, it should check whether the command
is a built-in command or not.   If it is, it should not be executed like
other programs. Instead, your shell will invoke your implementation of the
built-in command.  


<p>The UNIX shell has many built-in commands, such as <code>cd</code> ,
<code>echo</code> , <code>pwd</code> , etc.  In this project, you will only
implement three built-in commands: <b>exit</b>, <b>cd</b> and <b>pwd</b>,
specifically by using the <code>exit(0)</code>, <code>chdir</code>,
<code>getcwd</code>, and <code>getenv</code> system/library calls.  For
example, to implement the <code>exit</code> built-in command, you simply call
<code>exit(0);</code> in your C program.</p>  Your shell users will be happy
with the cd+pwd feature because they can change their working directory.
Without this feature, your user is stuck in a single directory.


<!-- ------------------------------- spec -->
<h3>Redirection (">")</h3> 

<p>
Often, a shell user prefers to send the output of his/her program to a
file rather than to the screen. The UNIX shell provides this nice feature
with the <code>">"</code> character. Formally this is called "redirection
of standard output." To make your shell users happy, your shell should also
include this feature.</p>

<p>
For example, if a user types <code>"ls -la /tmp > output"</code> , nothing
should be printed on the screen. Instead, the output of the
<code>ls</code> program should be rerouted to the <code>output</code> file.</p> 

<p>If the <code>"output"</code> file already exists before you run your
program, you should print the one and only error message (see "Error
Message" section below), and move on to the next command. Your shell should
keep running. If the output file is not specified (e.g. <code> "ls >
"</code> ), you should also print the error message.</p>

<p>If the command before redirection is a built-in command
(for example, <code>"cd > output"</code>), you should also throw 
the error message.  Built-in commands should be called without 
any redirection. 


<!-- ------------------------------- spec -->
<h3>Advanced Redirection (">+")</h3> 

<p>In addition to the ">" basic redirection, you also
need to support a custom advanced redirection ">+".

<p>For example, if I type <code>program >+ outputFile</code>,
it will <b>insert</b> the program's output to the <b>beginning</b> of
the outputFile <b>without overwriting</b> the old content.
That is the old content will be shifted. 

<p>If the outputFile does not exist, ">+" will behave like ">".

<p>This is a feature that does not exist in typical shell programs.  That
is, ">" overwrites the output file and ">>" appends to the end of the
output file (in this project you don't need to support ">>").  But, there
is no support to "insert" the output to the beginning of the file.

<p>To give you a specific example, let's imagine two input files
<code>aaa</code> and <code>bbb</code> that 
contains "aaa" and "bbb" respectively.  If you run the following
commands below, you should see "bbbaaa" printed on the screen.

<blockquote><pre>
<i>(outputFile does not exist before)</i>
myshell> cat aaa >+ outputFile
myshell> cat bbb >+ outputFile 
myshell> cat outputFile<pre></blockquote> 


<!-- ------------------------------- spec -->
<h3>White Spaces</h3> 

<p>Zero or more spaces can exist between a command and the shell
special characters (i.e. <code>";"</code> and <code>">"</code> ). All of
these examples are correct.</p> 

<blockquote><pre>
myshell> ls;ls;ls
myshell> ls ; ls ; ls
myshell> ls>a; ls > b; ls> c; ls >d<pre></blockquote> 

<p>If you are unsure whether a particular command is valid or not, the
rule of thumb is to try it in the UNIX shell. If the UNIX shell
accepts that command, your shell should accept the same command.</p> 

<!-- ------------------------------- spec -->
<h3>Batch Mode</h3> 

<p>So far, you have run the shell in interactive mode. Most of the
time, testing your shell in interactive mode is time-consuming. To
make testing much faster, your shell should support <b>batch mode</b>.</p> 

<p>In interactive mode, you display a prompt and the user of the shell
will type in one or more commands at the prompt. In batch mode, your
shell is started by specifying a batch file on its command line; the
batch file contains the same list of commands as you would have typed
in the interactive mode.</p> 

<p>In batch mode, you should <b>not</b> display a prompt. In batch mode
you should print each line you read from the batch file back to the
user before executing it; this will help you when you debug your
shells (and us when we test your programs). To print the command line,
<b>do not use printf</b> because printf will buffer the string in the C
library and will not work as expected when you perform automated
testing. To print the command line, use write(STDOUT_FILENO, ...) this
way:</p> 

<blockquote><pre>
write(STDOUT_FILENO, cmdline, strlen(cmdline));
</pre></blockquote>


<p>In both interactive and batch mode, your shell terminates when it
sees the <code>exit</code> command on a line or reaches the end of the input
stream (i.e., the end of the batch file).</p> 

<p>To run in batch mode, your C program must be invoked exactly as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
myshell [batchFile]
</pre></blockquote>


<p>The command line arguments to your shell are to be interpreted as follows.</p> 

<blockquote>batchFile: an optional argument (often indicated by square
brackets as above). If present, your shell will read each line of the
batchFile for commands to be executed. If not present or readable, you
should print the one and only error message (see "Error Message" section
below).</blockquote> 

<p>Implementing batch mode should be very straightforward if your
shell code is nicely structured. The batch file basically contains the
same exact lines that you would have typed interactively in your
shell. For example, if in the interactive mode, you test your program
with these inputs:</p> 

<blockquote><pre>
linux3% ./myshell
myshell> ls ; who ; ps
<i>some output printed here</i> 
myshell> ls > /tmp/ls-out;;;; ps > /non-existing-dir/file;
<i>some output and error printed here</i> 
myshell> ls-who-ps
<i>some error printed here</i> 
<pre></blockquote> 

<p>then you could cut your testing time by putting the same input lines to
a batch file (for example myBatchFile):</p> 

<blockquote><pre>
ls ; who ; ps
ls > /tmp/ls-out;;;; ps > /non-existing-dir/file;
ls-who-ps
</pre></blockquote> 

<p>and run your shell in batch mode:</p> 

<blockquote><pre>
linux3% ./myshell myBatchFile
</pre></blockquote> 

<p>In this example, the output of the batch mode should look like this:</p> 

<blockquote><pre>
ls ; who ; ps
<i>some output printed here</i> 
ls > /tmp/ls-out;;;; ps > /non-existing-dir/file;
<i>some output and error printed here</i> 
ls-who-ps
<i>some error printed here</i> 
</pre></blockquote>


<p>Handling <b>blank lines:</b>: In batch mode, 
if the input file contains blank lines, do <b>not</b> print the blank lines.  



<!-- ------------------------------- spec -->
<h3>Defensive Programming and Error Messages:</h3> 

<p>In this project, defensive programming is also required. Your program
should check all parameters, error-codes, etc.  In general, there should be
no circumstances in which your C program will core dump, hang indefinitely,
or prematurely terminate.  Therefore, your program must respond to all
input in a reasonable manner; by "reasonable", we mean print the error
message (as specified in the next paragraph) and either continue processing
or exit, depending upon the situation.</p>

<p>Since your code will be graded with automated testing, you should
print this <b>one and only error message</b> whenever you encounter an
error of any type: </p>

<blockquote><pre>
char error_message[30] = "An error has occurred\n";
write(STDOUT_FILENO, error_message, strlen(error_message));
</pre></blockquote>


<p>The error message should be printed to <b>stdout</b> (not stderr!).
Also, do not attempt to add whitespaces or tabs or extra error
messages.

<p>You should consider the following situations as errors; in each
case, your shell should print the error message to stdout and <b>exit</b> 
gracefully:

<ul>
<li>Two or more input files to your shell program.</li> 
<!-- <li><strike>An incorrect number of command line arguments to your shell 
program.</strike></li>  -->
<!-- Shiqin added the first <li> above, and the strike the second,
not sure why <li> -->
</ul> 

<p>For the following situation, you should print the error message to
stdout and <b>continue</b> processing:</p> 

<ul>
<li>A command does not exist or cannot be executed.</li> 
<li>A very long command line (over 512 characters, excluding the carriage return).</li> 
</ul> 

<p>
Your shell should also be able to handle the following scenarios below,
which are
<b>not errors</b> . The best way to check if something should return
an error is by <b>checking our test files and the expected outputs</b>.


<ul>
<li>An empty command line.</li> 
<li>An empty command between two or more ';' characters.</li> 
<li>Multiple white spaces on a command line.</li> 
<li>White space before or after the ';' character or extra white space in general.</li> 
</ul> 

All of these requirements will be tested extensively! These lists
will likely to grow as we receive questions from you.

<h1>Hints and Details</h1> 


<p>Writing your shell in a simple manner is a matter of finding the
relevant library routines and calling them properly. To simplify things for
you in this assignment, we will suggest a few library routines you may want
to use to make your coding easier.  To find information on these library
routines, look at the manual pages (using the Unix command <b>man</b>).</p>



<!-- ------------------------------- details -->
<h3>Parsing a Command Line</h3> 


<p><b>Parsing:</b> For reading lines of input, you may want to look at <b>
fgets().</b> To open a file and get a handle with type <b>FILE *</b> , look
into <b>fopen()</b> library call.  
Be sure to check the return code of these routines
for errors! (If you see an error, the routine <b>perror()</b> is useful
for displaying the problem. <i>But do not print the error message from
perror() to the screen. You should only print the one and only error
message that we have specified above</i>). You also may find the <b>strtok()
</b> routine useful for parsing the command line (i.e., for extracting the
arguments within a command separated by whitespace or a tab).</p>



<p><b>Too-long command line:</b> A command line that is too long consists
of more than 512 of <b>any</b> characters excluding the newline character
(Hint: so you must create an array of 514 characters to carry the newline
and null-termination character). If you type more than 512 white spaces, it
is considered as an invalid command line. 

<p>When you encounter a line that is
too long, print the whole line, print the error message, then throw
the line away (i.e. do not execute any command in this line), and
continue to the next command line. If the too-long command line only
consists of whitespaces, you still need to print the whole line.</p> 

<p>If a command line is too long, you need a special routine to read the
rest of characters in the invalid command line, and throw those characters
away. For example if a command line is 520 characters long, your special
handling routine should read the 8 remaining characters and throw them
away. Not doing this will make your shell erratic.</p>



<!-- ------------------------------- details -->
<h3>Basic Shell</h3>

<p>
<b>Executing Commands:</b> Look into <b>fork</b> , <b>execvp</b> ,
and <b>wait/waitpid</b> . See the UNIX man pages for these functions.
Before starting this project, you should definitely play around with these
functions.</p>

<p>You will note that there are a variety of commands in the <code>
exec</code> family; for this project, you must use <b>execvp</b> . You
should <b>not</b> use the <b>system()</b> call to run a command. Remember
that if execvp() is successful, it will not return; if it does return,
there was an error (e.g., the command does not exist). The most challenging
part is specifying the correct arguments. The first argument
specifies the program that should be executed, including the full path
to the program; this is straight-forward. The second argument, <code>char
*argv[]</code> matches those that the program sees in its function
prototype:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]);
</pre> </blockquote> 

<p>
Note that this argument is an array of strings, or an array of pointers to
characters. For example, if you invoke a program with:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
foo 205 535
</pre> </blockquote> 

<p>
then argv[0] = "foo", argv[1] = "205" and argv[2] = "535".</p> 

<p>
Important: the list of arguments must be terminated with a NULL pointer;
that is, argv[3] = NULL. We strongly recommend that you carefully check
that you are constructing this array correctly!</p>


<!-- ------------------------------- details -->
<h3>Multiple Commands</h3> 

<p>If you get your basic shell running, supporting multiple commands should
be straight-forward. The only difference here is that you need to wait for
the previous process to finish before creating a new one.  To do that, you
simply use <b>waitpid()</b> again.</p>


<!-- ------------------------------- details -->
<h3>Built-in Commands</h3> 


For this project, you should throw an error if redirection is
applied to built-in command (e.g., "pwd > output" is considered
illegal)


<p>For the 'exit' built-in command, you should simply call 'exit();'. Your
shell process will exit, and the parent (i.e. the real shell terminal) will
be notified.</p>


<p>For managing the current working directory, you should use <b>getenv</b>,
<b>chdir</b>, and <b>getcwd</b> . The getenv() system call is useful when you
want to go to your $HOME directory. The getcwd() system call is useful when you
need to know the current working directory; i.e. if a user types pwd, you
simply call getcwd(). And finally, chdir() is useful for moving between
directories.  Note that you do not need to manage the $PWD environmental
variable.  Your job is simple.  If when a user types "cd", you should change to
to the home directory, which you can get from the getenv(HOME).  When a user
types cd aPath, then just pass that aPath to the chdir() call.  


<p>Extra notes on $PWD: In the UNIX shell, when you run "echo $PWD" and
"pwd", you sometimes get different outputs.  The reason is there are two
places where you can get the current working directory. The pwd call gets
the string from getcwd() system call which will give you the absolute path,
while the second gets the string from the getenv("PWD") system call. So,
you might ask which string should you use. The answer is you should use the
absolute path from getcwd().  Thus, again, you do not have to manage
the $PWD variable. This will reduce the code you need to write.


<p>You do not have to support tilde (~) in this project.



<!-- ------------------------------- details -->
<h3>White Spaces</h3> 


<p>The exact formats for <b>exit</b>, <b>cd</b> and <b>pwd</b> are:</p> 

<blockquote><pre>
[optionalSpace]exit[optionalSpace]
[optionalSpace]pwd[optionalSpace]
[optionalSpace]cd[optionalSpace]
[optionalSpace]cd[optionalSpace]dir[optionalSpace]
</pre></blockquote> 

<p>Any other formats should not be accepted, i.e. do not run the
command, but do print the error message and continue processing the next
command. optionalSpace implies there could be 0 or more whitespaces.


<!-- 
<strike>
Note that the UNIX shell allows you to redirect pwd output to
a file (e.g. <code>pwd > output</code> ). In this project, we make things
easier for you, i.e. pwd should be called without arguments or
redirection.</p> </strike>
-->


<p>A tab is considered as a white space.</p> 


<!-- ------------------------------- details -->
<h3>Redirection Hints</h3> 

<p>Redirection is probably the trickiest part of this project. For
this you need <b>dup()/dup2()</b> (As usual, read the man pages). You
actually do not need to use pipe() (unless you want to be fancy).

<p>The idea of using dup2 is to intercept the byte stream going to the
standard output (i.e. your screen), and redirect the stream to your
designated file. dup2 uses file descriptors, which implies that you need to
understand what a file descriptor is. 

<p>With file descriptor, you can perform reads and writes to a file. Maybe in
your life so far, you have only used <b>fopen()</b>, <b> fread()</b>, and
<b>fwrite()</b> for reading and writing to a file.  Unfortunately, these
functions work on <b>FILE*</b> structures, which are C library abstractions
rather than a UNIX abstractions; when using FILE* structures, the file
descriptors are hidden. Hence, it is impossible for you to use dup2 with these
particular functions.

<p>To work on file descriptors, you should use the <b>creat()</b>,
<b>open()</b>, <b>read()</b>, and <b>write()</b> system calls. These functions
perform their works by using file descriptors.  (Again, check out the "man"
pages.)  Before reading forward, you should familiarize  yourself familiar with
file descriptor interface.

<p>The idea of redirection is to make the stdout descriptor point to
your output file descriptor. First of all, let's understand the
STDOUT_FILENO file descriptor. When a command <code>"ls -la /tmp"</code> 
runs, the ls program prints its output to the screen. But obviously,
the ls program does not know what a screen is. All it knows is that
the screen is basically pointed by the STDOUT_FILENO file
descriptor. In other words, you could rewrite <code>printf("hi")</code> in
this way: <code>write(STDOUT_FILENO, "hi", 2)</code> .</p> 

<p>To give yourself some practice, create a simple program where you
create an output file, intercept stdout, and call printf("hello").
When you create your output file, you should get the corresponding file
descriptor. To intercept stdout, you should call <code>
"dup2(output_fd, STDOUT_FILENO);"</code> . If you run your program, you
should not see "hello" printed on the screen. Instead, the word has
been redirected to your output file.</p> 

<p>In short, to intercept your 'ls' output, you should redirect stdout
before you execute ls, i.e. make the dup2() call before the exec('ls')
call.</p> 


<p><b>Redirection given a non-existing or non-runnable program:</b> When
you run a non-existing/non-runnable program with redirection, e.g. <code>
noprogram > output</code> , you should print the error message, but the
question is where? to output or to stdout? Our "intention" is to print the
error message to stdout, but that is impossible because you have redirected
your stdout to the output file (actually it is possible, but it requires a
little bit more work).   Therefore, <code> write(STDOUT_FILENO, ... error message
...)</code> will actually be rerouted to the output file, and that is okay.
This simplification should (again) make your life easier.

<p>More specifically, when you create a child process with redirection, you
need to intercept stdout to your output fd before you call execvp.
Then, you run execvp(noprogram), and it will return an error because
noprogram cannot be found. Then, your child process will call <code>
write(STDOUT_FILENO, ... error message ...)</code> , but the stdout file
descriptor of your child process has been "rerouted" to the output
fd. Hence, the error message will appear in the output file.


<p><b>Redirection format:</b> Whenever you find a redirection
character '>' in a command, you should check whether the format of the
command is correct or not before running the program. The format of a
valid redirection command looks like:</p> 

<blockquote><pre>
[optSpace]progAndArgs[optSpace]>[optSpace]outFile[optSpace]
</pre></blockquote>


<p>progAndArgs is basically the program and all the arguments that a user
types in. optSpace implies there could be 0 or more whitespaces (including
tabs). The output file, outFile, should consist of characters without any
white spaces. Also note that in a valid redirection command, the '>'
character only appears once. Whenever you encounter an invalid redirection
command, you should print the one and only error message (you should know
it by now), and continue processing the next command. Here are some
examples of invalid redirection command:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
ls > out1 out2
ls > out1 out2 out3
ls > out1 > out2
</pre></blockquote> 


<!-- ------------------------------- details -->
<h3>Defensive Programming and Error Messages</h3> 


<p><b>No printf!</b> When you want to print a command line or error
message, your shell code should <b>never use printf</b> . Instead, use
write(STDOUT_FILENO, ...). For example:</p> 

<blockquote><pre>
write(STDOUT_FILENO, cmdline, strlen(cmdline));
char error_message[30] = "An error has occurred\n";
write(STDOUT_FILENO, error_message, strlen(error_message));
</pre></blockquote> 

<p>The reason is quite complicated. In short, you will test your shell in
an automated way and using printf in your shell code will make the output
undeterministic. 



<p><b>Shell-related vs. program-related errors.</b> Note that there is a
difference between errors that your shell catches and those that the
program catches. Your shell should catch all the syntax errors specified in
this project page. If the syntax of the command looks perfect, you simply
run the specified program. If there is any program-related errors
(e.g. invalid arguments), let the program prints its specific error
messages to anywhere it wants (e.g. could be stdout or stderr). For
example, if you run <code>program > output</code> , and the program throws
some error messages to stdout, they will be automatically rerouted to
output file (see the next clarification below for more). But if the program
throws some error messages to stderr, let it be like that (i.e., you do not
have to do extra work to reroute stderr to output file or stdout).</p>



<!-- ------------------------------- details -->
<h3>Miscellaneous Hints/Notes</h3> 

<p>Remember to get the <b>basic functionality</b> of your shell working
before worrying about all of the error conditions and end cases. For
example, first get a single command running (probably first a command with
no arguments, such as "ls"). Then try adding more arguments.</p>

<p>Next, try working on multiple commands. Make sure that you are correctly
handling all of the cases where there is miscellaneous white space around
commands or missing commands. Finally, add built-in commands and
redirection support.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you check the return codes of all system
calls from the very beginning of your work. This will often catch errors in
how you are invoking these new system calls.</p>

<p>Beat up your own code! You are the best (and in this case, the only)
tester of this code. Throw lots of junk at it and make sure the shell
behaves well. Good code comes through testing -- you must run all sorts of
different tests to make sure things work as desired. Don't be gentle --
other users certainly won't be. Break it now so we don't have to break it
later.</p>

<p>There was a case in the past where "ls" returns a different ordering of
filenames on a student laptop.  If you have this problem,
check your $LANG environment variable (run "echo $LANG") and make sure it 
is set to "en_US" or "en_US.UTF-8".

<h1>Hand-in</h1> 

<p>You should create <b>p4shell</b> directory in your SVN, at the same directory
level as your other projects.

<p>Inside the p4shell directory, you should submit only the following
files:
<b>myshell.c</b> and <b>README</b>.

<p>Your entire shell code should be put into only one file: myshell.c

<p>To ensure that we compile your C correctly for the demo, you will
need to create a simple <b>Makefile;</b> this way our scripts can just
run <code>make</code> to compile your code with the right libraries and
flags. 

<p>
The name of your final executable should be <code>myshell</code>.
This is what we will run when grading your work:

<blockquote><pre>
% rm -f myshell
% make
% ./myshell pathToTestFile
</pre></blockquote> 

<p>Your README file ("README" without file extension) should describe what
functionalities are not working.  If you think your code is perfect, simply
write "All good".</p>

<h1>Automated Testing and Grading</h1> 

<p>We will run your program on a suite of batch files, some of which will
exercise your programs ability to correctly execute commands and some of
which will test your programs ability to catch error conditions. Be sure
that you thoroughly exercise your program's capabilities on a wide range of
batch files, so that you will not be unpleasantly surprised when we run our
tests.

<p>To automate grading, we will heavily use the batch mode.  
If you do
everything correctly except the batch mode, you 
will <b>not</b> get partial credits.
Hence,
make sure you can read and run the commands in the batch file.  

<p>We release all the test scripts, input, output you need to test your program.
They can be found here:

<blockquote><pre>
<a href="https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/37621/files/folder/Assignments?preview=6484698">p4.zip</a>
</pre></blockquote>


Also, <b>please read the 
<a href="https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/37621/files/folder/Assignments?preview=6484730">README-p4</a>
file</b> first.  This README file contains everything you need to know
regarding running the batch files.


<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: <b>Do NOT manually</b> check your outputs with the
expected outputs. You <b>must</b> compare them with the <b>diff</b>
command line.  The scripts that we provide to you 
essentially run this:


<blockquote><pre>
% ./myshell (pathToBatchFiles)/bf 1> bf.out 2> bf.err
% diff bf.out (pathToExpectedOutput)/bf.out
% diff bf.err (pathToExpectedOutput/bf.err
</pre></blockquote>



<p>The command above executes your shell which will run all the
commands in "bf" testfile.  All stdout and stderr outputs of this
execution will automatically go to "bf.out" and "bf.err".
The "diff" command line compares your result with our expected result.
If there is any discrepancies, the diff command will tell you the
differences. If not, nothing will be printed out to the screen.

<p>
To make sure ">" works here, do <b>not</b> overwrite with the stdout
and stderr file descriptors that belong to the parent process (the
myshell process).  You should only overwrite the stdout and stderr
descriptors in child processes.


<p>
Finally, we encourage you to make progress by passing 
<b>one test at a time</b>.  Do not try to write lots of code without
testing any single test file.  As you implement more features, make sure
you re-run all the prior tests again.  It's possible that prior tests
that you passed are now failing because of your new code.


<h2>How to not get a ZERO?</h2>

<p>Well, do some work obviously.  In general, almost all students
in the class
pay a close attention to our project specifications (great job! we appreciate it!).
However, there are always a few students who take project
specifications lightly, get a zero, but then expect some credits.  In
this project, there is <b>no exception</b>.


<!-- next year must PUT THIS !!!!!!!
<p> You will get a zero if you cannot run in batch mode.
No excuses!

<p>Do NOT create temporary files at all!! Your shell should not
create other files except what is .
some students in the past put some /tmp/.. and when we grade it
it gets problem.
-->

<p>
You will get a <b>zero</b> on a testfile if your output is different
than the expected output (yes, even if it's because of one blankspace!).
That is, given a testfile, there is <b>no partial credit</b> (i.e. a
test result is either pass or fail, nothing in between).  Again, please
use <b>diff</b> to check every test output.  The only "partial credit"
is based on how many testfiles you pass.

In the past some students only ran <code>./myshell testfile</code>
and manually "eyeball" the output on the screen with the expected
output.  This manual approach is not acceptable. 

<p> You will get <b>zero</b> if we cannot redirect the output of your
shell to a file (i.e. if we cannot run <code>./myshell testfile >
output</code>).  As mentioned above, do not overwrite parent's stdout and
stderr descriptors.

<p>
You will get a <b>zero</b> if your code contains the word
<code>"system"</code> or any 
<code>"#include&ltpath-to-your-library&gt"</code>.
That is, if you try to cheat by using the system() library call
or calling your own hidden library, we will severely penalize you.
Please don't be tricksy, it's just a simple shell. 

<p>
You will get a <b>zero</b> if we find you copy-paste code from other sources.
Remember, we have a database of many solutions and will run a code
comparator.

<p>
You will get a <b>zero</b> if you try to copy the expected output manually
or in some tricksy ways.  Note that when we grade your code, we will use
different input contents.  Those who implement the right logic will not be
affected by changes in the input content.  But those who manually
manufacture the outputs will be affected.



<h1>Provided Materials</h1> 

<p>We have seeded your repositories with a code skeleton
(p4shell/myshell.c) and a Makefile (please do not modify the Makefile).
