# Project 2: Bomb Lab

The goal of this project was to “defuse” a “binary bomb”. The bomb is an executable binary, compiled from C code, consisting of a sequence of six phases, each of which prompts to enter a string to be defused. GDB was used to examine their Assembly instructions for the right key string.
