# CS15400: Introduction to Computer Systems

CS154 covers the basics of computer systems from a programmer's perspective. Topics include data representation, machine language programming, exceptions, memory systems, and being the client of an operating system. Projects in this repository are from Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective (3rd edition), by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O’Hallaron, and were slightly modified by the UChicago faculties.
